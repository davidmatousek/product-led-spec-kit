# CLAUDE.md - {{PROJECT_NAME}}

<!-- Generated by Product-Led-Spec-Kit -->

## Core Constraints
- **Product-Led**: Start with product vision, PRDs, and user stories
- **Source of Truth**: `.specify/spec.md`
- **Validation Required**: Run `/speckit.analyze` before PRs
- **Local-First**: Always supports local `.specify/` file workflows

## Git Workflow
Feature branches required. Never commit to main directly.
@.claude/rules/git-workflow.md

## Project Structure
```
{{PROJECT_NAME}}/
├── .claude/           → Agents, skills, commands
├── .specify/          → spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md (source of truth)
├── docs/              → Product, architecture, devops docs
├── scripts/           → init.sh, check.sh
└── CLAUDE.md          → AI agent context
```

**Note**: Template provides methodology only. Users bring their own code (backend/, frontend/, etc.).

## Scope Boundaries
Defines what this project is and is not.
@.claude/rules/scope.md

## Commands
Triad (governance) and Vanilla (fast) command sets.
@.claude/rules/commands.md

## SDLC Triad Workflow
PM defines What/Why, Architect defines How, Team-Lead defines When/Who.
@.claude/rules/governance.md

## Context Loading
Load governance context by domain using @-references.
@.claude/rules/context-loading.md

## Governance Workflow (MANDATORY)
Specs require PM sign-off. Plans require PM + Architect. Tasks require triple sign-off.
@.claude/rules/governance.md

## Deployment Policy (MANDATORY)
All deployments must go through the devops agent.
@.claude/rules/deployment.md

## Key Principles
- **Vision First**: `/triad.vision` → PRD → spec → plan → tasks
- **Triple Sign-off**: PM + Architect + Team-Lead approval on tasks.md
- **Definition of Done**: 3-step validation before marking complete

## Tips
- Use `make review-spec` or `make review-plan` for manual governance checks
- Review `agent-assignments.md` for workload distribution
