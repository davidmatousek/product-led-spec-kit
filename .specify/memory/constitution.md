# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. General-Purpose Architecture

{{PROJECT_NAME}} MUST be domain-agnostic and work with any agent-based development workflow. The platform SHALL NOT contain security-specific, domain-specific, or use-case-specific logic in core components.

**Rationale**: As a standalone SaaS platform, {{PROJECT_NAME}} must serve diverse projects across industries. Domain-specific features limit adoption and create maintenance burden.

**Requirements**:
- Core API endpoints are use-case neutral (tasks, knowledge, strategy)
- No hardcoded assumptions about project types or domains
- Extensibility through configuration, not code modifications
- Documentation uses generic examples applicable across domains

### II. API-First Design

All functionality MUST be accessible via RESTful API before any UI or MCP interface is implemented. API contracts are the source of truth for system capabilities.

**Rationale**: API-first ensures consistency across interfaces (web UI, MCP, CLI) and enables programmatic integration. This principle prevents UI-driven design that creates backend retrofitting.

**Requirements**:
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification maintained for all endpoints
- API versioning follows semantic versioning (v1, v2, etc.)
- Breaking changes require new API version, not in-place modifications
- MCP tools and web UI are thin clients over the same API layer
- All state mutations go through API (no direct database access from clients)

### III. Backward Compatibility (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The system MUST maintain 100% backward compatibility with local Triad `.specify/` file workflows. Agents can always fall back to local files if the cloud service is unavailable.

**Rationale**: Forced migrations create adoption barriers and single points of failure. Local-first fallback ensures developers are never blocked by network issues or service outages.

**Requirements**:
- MCP server detects service availability and falls back gracefully
- Local `.specify/` files remain valid and usable without modification
- Migration from local to cloud is opt-in, never forced
- Import/export tools support bidirectional sync
- No data loss when switching between local and cloud modes

### IV. Concurrency & Data Integrity

All state transitions MUST be atomic with ACID guarantees. Task locking prevents race conditions. Lock expiration prevents deadlocks from crashed agents.

**Rationale**: Multi-agent workflows are the core value proposition. Without robust concurrency control, the platform fails its primary purpose.

**Requirements**:
- Optimistic locking with `locked_until` timestamp for tasks
- Lock timeout defaults to 10 minutes, configurable per project
- Database transactions ensure atomicity of state changes
- Clear error messages when lock conflicts occur (include holder identity)
- Audit logging for all state transitions (debugging and compliance)
- No manual locks - all locks managed by system with automatic expiration

### V. Privacy & Data Isolation

Project data MUST be isolated per user/organization with strict access controls. Vector embeddings and knowledge base content are encrypted at rest.

**Rationale**: SaaS platforms handle sensitive intellectual property. Security breaches destroy trust and violate legal compliance requirements.

**Requirements**:
- Row-level security enforced at database layer
- API authentication required for all endpoints (JWT tokens)
- API keys are rotatable and revocable
- Vector embeddings encrypted at rest (AES-256 or equivalent)
- Rate limiting per user (default: 100 requests/minute)
- No cross-project data leakage in search results or API responses
- Audit logs for access and modifications

### VI. Testing Excellence

Testing is MANDATORY for {{PROJECT_NAME}}. All features MUST have corresponding test coverage before being marked as complete.

**Rationale**: As a SaaS platform managing critical development workflows, reliability and correctness are non-negotiable. Comprehensive testing builds user trust and prevents regressions.

**Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Required for all business logic (minimum 80% coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Required for API endpoints, MCP tools, and database operations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Required for critical user workflows (task claiming, knowledge search, multi-agent coordination)
- **Performance Tests**: Required for concurrency scenarios, vector search, and API response times
- **Test-First Development**: Tests written BEFORE implementation for core features
- **Contract Testing**: Required for all API endpoints and MCP protocol compliance
- **Continuous Testing**: All tests run in CI/CD pipeline; failing tests block merges

**Testing Framework**:
- Test frameworks appropriate to technology stack (Jest, Pytest, Playwright, etc.)
- Test execution documented in project README
- Test results visible in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance benchmarks tracked over time

### VII. Definition of Done (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every feature and deliverable MUST complete all validation steps before being marked as "DELIVERED". This is a constitutional mandate that cannot be bypassed.

**Rationale**: Three-step validation ensures production-ready quality, real-world usability, and actual user value delivery. It prevents premature completion declarations and ensures reliable deployments.

**Non-Negotiable Validation Steps**:
1. **✅ Pushed to Production** - Feature deployed and operational in production environment
2. **✅ Tested** - All automated tests pass (unit, integration, E2E, performance)
3. **✅ User Validated** - Real-world usage confirmed working by actual users or stakeholders

**Quality Gates**:
- No feature marked complete until all DoD steps verified
- Test coverage meets minimum thresholds (80% for unit tests)
- User acceptance required for all customer-facing functionality
- Performance requirements met (API <500ms, search <2s)
- Documentation updated and accurate

**Enforcement**:
- See `docs/standards/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` for detailed validation procedures
- Features that skip any step MUST be reverted to in-progress status
- DoD checklist required in all PRs for feature work

**Exceptions**:
- Documentation-only changes may not require production deployment
- Architecture/planning phases validated through implementation phases
- Infrastructure changes validated through smoke tests and monitoring

### VIII. Observability & Root Cause Analysis

All complex work and debugging sessions MUST capture learnings and patterns for institutional knowledge. Root cause analysis prevents surface-level fixes.

**Rationale**: Observability ensures rapid issue resolution, captures organizational learning, and prevents repeated mistakes. Root cause analysis addresses underlying problems rather than symptoms.

**Requirements**:
- **Five Whys Methodology**: ALWAYS use Five Whys Root Cause Analysis for complex issues (see `docs/core_principles/01-FIVE_WHYS_METHODOLOGY.md`)
- **Structured Logging**: Required for all critical operations (API requests, task state changes, lock operations, search queries)
- **Health Checks**: Required for all services (API `/health` endpoint, MCP server status, database connectivity)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track API response times, search latency, concurrent agent metrics
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error handling with automatic retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
- **Audit Logging**: All state transitions logged for debugging and compliance

**Error Handling Standards**:
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable (fallback to local files)
- Clear, actionable error messages for users and agents
- Rate limiting with appropriate backoff strategies
- Automated alerting for system health issues

**Knowledge Capture**:
- Document root cause analyses in project documentation
- Capture patterns and solutions for future reference
- Share learnings across team through PRs and retrospectives

### IX. Git Workflow & Feature Branching (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

ALL development work MUST use feature branches. Direct commits to main branch are STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

**Rationale**: Feature branch workflow prevents accidental main branch corruption, enables code review, maintains development history for debugging and auditing, and supports multi-agent collaboration.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ALWAYS use feature branches: `git checkout -b NNN-feature-name`
- NEVER commit directly to main branch
- ALWAYS create PR (Pull Request) for review before merge
- Branch naming: `NNN-descriptive-name` (e.g., `001-task-locking-api`)
- NEVER run destructive git commands (force push, hard reset) without explicit user request
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign) without explicit user request

**Commit Standards**:
- Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`
  - Scopes: `api`, `mcp`, `database`, `auth`, `ui`, `infra`, `test`
- Include descriptive commit body explaining "why" not "what"
- Reference related issues: `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
- Include agent co-authorship: `Co-Authored-By: Agent <agent@{{PROJECT_NAME}}>`
- Run `git status` before and after commits to verify changes

**Pull Request Requirements**:
- Title follows convention: `type(scope): description`
- Description explains objective, changes, testing, and validation
- All automated tests pass (CI/CD pipeline)
- Code review approval required (minimum 1 reviewer)
- Constitution compliance verified
- Security scan passes (no vulnerabilities)
- Documentation updated if applicable

**Branch Protection**:
- Main branch requires PR reviews before merge
- All CI/CD status checks must pass
- Branches must be up to date before merging
- Enforce code review from CODEOWNERS for critical paths

**Reference**: See `docs/standards/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` for detailed git workflow guidance

### X. Product-Spec Alignment & Architecture Review (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

ALL Triad artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) MUST receive dual sign-off before implementation begins:
1. **Product Manager (product-manager)** validates product alignment and user value
2. **Architect** validates technical soundness and architectural consistency

Product artifacts in docs/product/ are the strategic foundation, and project architecture in docs/architecture/ is the technical foundation that specifications must serve.

**Rationale**:
- **Product Alignment**: Technical excellence without product alignment wastes resources building the wrong solution. The Product Manager ensures every feature serves user needs, supports strategic objectives, and delivers measurable value.
- **Architecture Review**: Sound product strategy without technical consistency creates fragmented systems. The Architect ensures every technical decision aligns with project architecture, maintains system integrity, and avoids technical debt.

**Non-Negotiable Requirements**:
- ALWAYS create PRD before spec.md (use prd-create skill)
- ALWAYS validate spec.md aligns with product vision, OKRs, and user stories
- ALWAYS get PM sign-off on spec.md before creating plan.md
- ALWAYS get Architect review on plan.md for technical decisions and architecture alignment
- ALWAYS get PM sign-off on plan.md before creating tasks.md
- ALWAYS get Architect review on tasks.md for implementation approach
- ALWAYS get PM sign-off on tasks.md before implementation begins
- NEVER implement features without documented product context
- NEVER implement technical designs that violate project architecture

**Product Manager Authority**:

The Product Manager (product-manager) has **VETO AUTHORITY** over:
1. **Spec Creation**: Can reject spec.md that doesn't align with product vision
2. **Plan Approval**: Can reject plan.md that doesn't fit roadmap or user value
3. **Task Prioritization**: Can reorder tasks.md to align with product priorities

**Architect Authority**:

The Architect has **VETO AUTHORITY** over:
1. **Plan Approval**: Can reject plan.md that violates project architecture or creates technical debt
2. **Technical Decisions**: Can require alternative approaches that maintain architectural consistency
3. **Task Implementation**: Can reject tasks.md that uses inappropriate patterns or technologies

**Collaborative Decision-Making**:

When PM and Architect disagree:
- PM has final authority on **WHAT** to build and **WHY** (product decisions)
- Architect has final authority on **HOW** to build it (technical decisions)
- If conflict persists, escalate to project lead with both perspectives documented

**Required Sign-Off Checklist**:

### XI. SDLC Triad Collaboration

**Objective**: Ensure Product, Architecture, and Engineering alignment through structured collaboration at PRD creation stage

#### The Triad

1. **Product-Manager (Product Manager)**: Defines **What** and **Why**
2. **Architect (System Architect)**: Defines **How** (Strategic/Technical)
3. **Tech-Lead (Engineering Manager)**: Defines **When** and **Who** (Tactical/Resourcing)

#### Triad Boundaries

| Role | MUST Do | MUST NOT Do |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **PM** | Define user problems, business value, priorities, validate product-market fit | Make technical decisions, estimate development timelines, claim infrastructure status without verification |
| **Architect** | Design architecture, select technology, document current state, provide infrastructure baselines | Manage timelines, assign agents to tasks, define user problems or business priorities |
| **Tech-Lead** | Estimate effort/timelines, assign agents, optimize execution, validate capacity | Rewrite architecture (unless timeline/budget breaks), change feature priorities, choose technology stack |

#### PRD Creation Workflow (Triad Collaboration)

**For Infrastructure/Deployment PRDs**:

0. **PM**: Analyze product need (What & Why) - read product vision, OKRs, user stories
0.5. **Architect**: Provide baseline report documenting current infrastructure state
1. **PM**: Draft PRD using prd-create skill, incorporating Architect baseline into "Current State" section
2. **Tech-Lead**: Feasibility review - estimate timeline, identify agents needed, validate capacity
3. **Architect**: Technical review - validate infrastructure claims match baseline, confirm technical feasibility
4. **PM**: Finalize PRD incorporating all Triad feedback

**For Feature PRDs** (greenfield work):

0. **PM**: Analyze product need (What & Why)
1. **PM**: Draft PRD using prd-create skill
2. **[Parallel]** Architect + Tech-Lead: Review PRD for technical feasibility and timeline accuracy
3. **PM**: Finalize PRD incorporating Triad feedback

**Auto-Detection Criteria**:
PRD is classified as "Infrastructure/Deployment" if topic/description contains keywords: "deploy", "deployment", "infrastructure", "production", "staging", "vercel", "database provisioning", "environment setup"

#### Validation Gates

All PRDs MUST have:
- ✅ Architect baseline report (if infrastructure work)
- ✅ Tech-Lead feasibility check with timeline estimate
- ✅ Architect technical review with approval
- ✅ PRD timeline based on Tech-Lead estimate (not PM guess)
- ✅ PRD infrastructure claims validated by Architect against baseline

#### Veto Authority Matrix

| Scenario | Who Can Veto | Veto Grounds |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| PRD claims infrastructure status | **Architect** | Claims contradict architecture baseline documentation |
| PRD proposes technical approach | **Architect** | Approach is technically infeasible or violates architectural principles |
| PRD estimates timeline | **Tech-Lead** | Timeline ignores capacity constraints or current completion state |
| PRD changes feature priority | **PM** | Misaligned with product vision, OKRs, or user needs |
| plan.md violates product requirements | **PM** | Technical design doesn't serve user needs or business goals |
| tasks.md timeline unrealistic | **Tech-Lead** | Task breakdown doesn't account for dependencies or capacity |

**Veto Process**:
1. Agent invokes veto with clear rationale and supporting evidence
2. Agent provides specific corrections required
3. Originating agent addresses corrections
4. Re-submit for review
5. Approve OR escalate to user for final decision

#### Triad Disagreement Escalation

**Level 1: Triad Negotiation** (<30 minutes)
- PM, Architect, Tech-Lead discuss disagreement
- Each agent presents rationale and supporting evidence
- Attempt to reach consensus or compromise

**Level 2: Constitution Arbitration** (<15 minutes)
- If no consensus, check Constitution for governing principle
- Apply constitutional principle to resolve disagreement
- Example: PM wants 2-week timeline, Tech-Lead says 4 weeks → Apply Principle IX (realistic timelines), defer to Tech-Lead's capacity-based estimate

**Level 3: User Decision** (variable time)
- If Constitution doesn't resolve, escalate to user
- Present both positions with pros/cons and evidence
- User makes final decision
- Document decision in PRD/spec with rationale for future reference

#### Success Criteria

- PRDs have <3 technical inaccuracies (measured by Architect review)
- PRD timelines within 20% of actual delivery (measured post-implementation)
- Architect review time <30 minutes for technical validation
- Triad workflow adds <2 hours to PRD creation cycle time (quality over speed)

#### Non-Compliance

- **PRD finalized without Triad review** → Reject PRD, request revision with proper Triad validation
- **PM makes technical claims without Architect validation** → Architect exercises veto authority
- **PM estimates timeline without Tech-Lead input** → Tech-Lead exercises veto authority
- **Repeated violations** → Escalate to user for governance review

#### Document Storage Standards

| Document | Location | Owner | Purpose |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| Architect Baseline | `specs/{feature-id}/architect-baseline.md` | Architect | Current infrastructure state for deployment PRDs |
| Feasibility Check | `specs/{feature-id}/feasibility-check.md` | Tech-Lead | Timeline, agent assignments, capacity validation |
| Architect PRD Review | `docs/agents/architect/{date}_{feature}_prd-review_ARCH.md` | Architect | Technical validation report |

**Reference**: See `docs/standards/TRIAD_COLLABORATION.md` for comprehensive Triad workflow guide, artifact templates, and practical examples
