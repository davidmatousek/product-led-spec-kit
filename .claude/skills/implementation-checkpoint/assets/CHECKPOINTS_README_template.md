# Implementation Checkpoints - {FEATURE_ID}

**Purpose**: Track implementation progress through strategic checkpoints
**Feature**: {FEATURE_NAME}
**Total Tasks**: {TOTAL_TASKS} tasks across {TOTAL_PHASES} phases

---

## Checkpoint Naming Convention

**Format**: `CHECKPOINT-{NN}_{Phase-Description}_{TaskRange}.md`

**Examples**:
- `CHECKPOINT-01_Phase1-2-Complete_T001-T030.md`
- `CHECKPOINT-02_US1-Complete_T001-T039.md`
- `CHECKPOINT-03_US2-Complete_T001-T055.md`

**Components**:
- `NN`: Sequential checkpoint number (01, 02, 03...)
- `Phase-Description`: Human-readable milestone description
- `TaskRange`: Start and end task IDs (e.g., T001-T030)

## Active Checkpoints

_Checkpoints will be added here as they are created._

## Future Checkpoints (Planned)

### Checkpoint 01 - Initial Milestone
**Planned Tasks**: T001-T030
**Scope**: TBD
**Estimated Date**: TBD
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started

## Checkpoint Guidelines

### When to Create a Checkpoint

Create a checkpoint when:
1. ✅ A complete phase is finished (e.g., Phase 1, Phase 2)
2. ✅ A user story is fully implemented (e.g., US1 complete)
3. ✅ A major milestone is reached (e.g., MVP core)
4. ✅ Before pausing for review or testing
5. ✅ After architect review approval

### Checkpoint Content Requirements

Each checkpoint report must include:
- **Executive Summary** - What was completed, what's next
- **Task Completion Status** - Detailed breakdown of completed vs pending
- **Files Created/Modified** - Complete list with file counts
- **Key Achievements** - Technical highlights and milestones
- **Knowledge Base Entries** - Critical learnings captured
- **Server/Database Status** - Current state of running services
- **Quality Metrics** - Code quality, tests, reviews
- **Remaining Work** - What's left to do
- **Resume Instructions** - How to continue implementation

### Checkpoint Metadata

All checkpoints should document:
- Feature ID and name
- Checkpoint number and description
- Date created
- Status (paused/completed/archived)
- Branch name
- Task range covered
- Progress percentage
- Next action/command

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Progress Formula
```
Progress % = (Completed Tasks / Total Tasks) * 100
```

### Estimated Timeline

| Checkpoint | Tasks | Progress | Duration | Status |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| **01** | T001-T030 | 0% | TBD | ⏳ Pending |
| **02** | T031-T060 | 0% | TBD | ⏳ Pending |
| **03** | T061-T090 | 0% | TBD | ⏳ Pending |
| **04** | T091-T120 | 0% | TBD | ⏳ Pending |

_Update this table as checkpoints are completed._
