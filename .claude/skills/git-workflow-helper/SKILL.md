# Git Workflow Helper Skill

## Purpose

Automates common git workflow tasks while enforcing best practices and commit standards. Implements FR-008 from the feature specification. Follows constitutional requirement for feature branching and proper git workflow.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Git Status Check

Always start with status to understand current state:

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Check branch name
git branch --show-current

# Check for uncommitted changes
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat

# Check unpushed commits
git log @{u}.. --oneline
```

Report:
```
📊 Git Status

Branch: feature/new-feature
Tracking: origin/feature/new-feature

Changes:
  Modified: 3 files
  Staged: 1 file
  Untracked: 2 files

Unpushed commits: 2

Files:
  M  src/api/users.ts
  M  tests/users.test.ts
  ?? docs/API.md
```

### Step 2: Branch Creation

Create feature branch following naming conventions:

```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout -b feature/feature-name

# Bug fix branch
git checkout -b fix/bug-description

# Documentation branch
git checkout -b docs/topic

# Test branch
git checkout -b test/test-description

# Refactor branch
git checkout -b refactor/refactor-description
```

### Step 3: Stage Files

Intelligently stage relevant files:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add src/api/users.ts src/models/user.ts

# Stage all in directory
git add src/

# Check what will be committed
git diff --cached
```

Avoid staging:
- Build artifacts (dist/, build/)
- Dependencies (node_modules/)
- Secrets (.env, credentials.json)
- Temporary files (*.tmp, *.log)

### Step 4: Generate Conventional Commit Message

Follow conventional commit format:

**Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tools

**Example Generation**:

Analyze staged changes:
```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
# Output:
# src/api/users.ts
# src/models/user.ts
# tests/users.test.ts
```

Analyze diff content:
```bash
git diff --cached src/api/users.ts
# Detect: New endpoint added
```

Generated message:
```
feat(api): Add user profile update endpoint

Implements user profile update functionality with validation
and authentication checks. Includes tests for success and error cases.

### Step 5: Create Commit

```bash
# Create commit with generated message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

Implements user profile update functionality with validation
and authentication checks. Includes tests for success and error cases.

)"

# Verify commit
git log -1 --format="%h %s"
```

### Step 6: Push Changes

```bash
# Push to remote (creates branch if needed)
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Verify push
git log @{u}.. --oneline
# (should be empty - all commits pushed)
```

### Step 7: Create Pull Request

Use gh CLI to create PR:

```bash
# Generate PR description from commits
PR_TITLE="feat(api): User Profile Management"
PR_BODY=$(git log origin/main..HEAD --format="- %s")

# Create PR
gh pr create \
  --title "$PR_TITLE" \
  --body "$(cat <<EOF
## Summary
${PR_BODY}

## Changes
- Added user profile update endpoint
- Implemented validation and auth checks
- Added comprehensive tests

## Testing
- Unit tests: ✓ Pass
- Integration tests: ✓ Pass
- Manual testing: ✓ Completed

# Get PR URL

```

## Examples

### Example 1: Commit Changes

**User Query**: "Commit my changes"

**Skill Actions**:
1. Run `git status` - 3 modified files
2. Analyze changes - new feature added
3. Stage relevant files
4. Generate conventional commit message
5. Create commit
6. Verify commit created

**Result**:
```
✅ Changes Committed

Branch: feature/user-profiles
Commit: a3f2c1d

Message:
  feat(api): Add user profile endpoints

  Implements GET and PUT endpoints for user profile management
  with validation and authentication.

  🤖 Generated with Claude Code

Staged files:
  src/api/users.ts
  src/models/user.ts
  tests/users.test.ts

Next steps:
  git push -u origin feature/user-profiles
```

### Example 2: Create Pull Request

**User Query**: "Create a pull request"

**Skill Actions**:
1. Check git status - on feature branch
2. Verify commits pushed to origin
3. Generate PR title and description from commits
4. Create PR using gh CLI
5. Get PR URL

**Result**:
```
✅ Pull Request Created

PR #42: feat(api): User Profile Management
URL: https://github.com/user/repo/pull/42

Summary:
- feat(api): Add user profile endpoints
- test(api): Add profile endpoint tests
- docs(api): Document profile API

Branch: feature/user-profiles → main

Status: Ready for review

The PR has been created successfully. Share the URL with your team!
```

### Example 3: Branch Creation

**User Query**: "Create a branch for the new notification system"

**Skill Actions**:
1. Check current branch - on main
2. Ensure working directory clean
3. Create feature branch
4. Verify branch created

**Result**:
```
✅ Branch Created

Branch: feature/notification-system
Base: main (a3f2c1d)

You're now on the new branch and ready to start work!

Workflow:
1. Make your changes
2. Commit with: "commit my changes"
3. Push with: git push -u origin feature/notification-system
4. Create PR with: "create PR"
```

## Integration

### Uses

- **Bash**: Execute git and gh CLI commands
- **Read**: Analyze changed files for commit message generation
- **Grep**: Pattern match for commit types and scopes
- **TodoWrite**: Track PR creation and review tasks

### Updates

- Git repository (commits, branches, pushes)
- GitHub (pull requests via gh CLI)

### Safety Features

- **Never force push** to main/master without explicit confirmation
- **Warn on destructive operations** (reset --hard, push --force)
- **Verify before push** - show what will be pushed
- **Check for secrets** before committing

## Commit Message Generation Logic

```bash
# Analyze file types
MODIFIED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

# Detect scope
if [[ $MODIFIED_FILES == *"src/api"* ]]; then
  SCOPE="api"
elif [[ $MODIFIED_FILES == *"tests/"* ]]; then
  SCOPE="test"
elif [[ $MODIFIED_FILES == *"docs/"* ]]; then
  SCOPE="docs"
fi

# Detect type
if grep -q "new.*function\|new.*class" <(git diff --cached); then
  TYPE="feat"
elif grep -q "fix\|bug" <(git diff --cached); then
  TYPE="fix"
elif [[ $MODIFIED_FILES == *".md" ]]; then
  TYPE="docs"
fi

# Generate message
COMMIT_MSG="${TYPE}(${SCOPE}): ${DESCRIPTION}"
```

## Constitutional Compliance

- **Git Workflow**: Enforces feature branching and proper workflow (Principle V)
- **Commit Standards**: Conventional commits for clarity
- **Never Skip Hooks**: Respects pre-commit hooks and validation
- **No Force Push**: Prevents destructive operations on shared branches
- **Safety First**: Warns before potentially dangerous git operations
