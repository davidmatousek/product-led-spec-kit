name: thinking-lens
description: Routes to structured thinking methodologies (lenses) for systematic analysis. Use this skill when you need to think through problems, apply thinking lenses, reason through decisions, or perform systematic analysis. Auto-selects appropriate lens based on context - 5 Whys for failures, Pre-Mortem for risks, First Principles for assumptions, Systems Thinking for architecture.

# Thinking Lens Skill

Router that selects and applies thinking methodologies from `docs/core_principles/`.

## Keyword → Lens Routing

| Keywords | Lens | File |
|----------|------|------|
| "failed", "broke", "why did", "root cause" | 5 Whys | `01-FIVE_WHYS_METHODOLOGY.md` |
| "assumptions", "fundamentally", "from scratch" | First Principles | `02-FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md` |
| "risks", "could go wrong", "before we start" | Pre-Mortem | `03-PRE_MORTEM.md` |
| "guarantee failure", "avoid", "anti-patterns" | Inversion | `04-INVERSION.md` |
| "prioritize", "most value", "80/20" | Pareto Analysis | `05-PARETO_ANALYSIS.md` |
| "architecture", "interact", "components" | Systems Thinking | `06-SYSTEMS_THINKING.md` |
| "consequences", "downstream", "side effects" | Second-Order Effects | `07-SECOND_ORDER_EFFECTS.md` |
| "blocked", "bottleneck", "dependencies" | Constraint Analysis | `08-CONSTRAINT_ANALYSIS.md` |
| "challenge", "critique", "wrong with this" | Devil's Advocate | `09-DEVILS_ADVOCATE.md` |
| "compare", "choose between", "options" | Comparative Analysis | `10-COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS.md` |
| "trade-off", "giving up", "sacrifice" | Opportunity Cost | `11-OPPORTUNITY_COST.md` |

## Workflow

1. **Route**: Match user keywords to lens using table above
2. **Load**: Read full methodology from `docs/core_principles/[FILE]`
3. **Apply**: Follow the step-by-step process and use template from that file

If ambiguous, ask:
> "Would you like to focus on **risks** (Pre-Mortem), **root cause** (5 Whys), or **trade-offs** (Opportunity Cost)?"

## Quick Reference

| Problem Type | Lens |
|--------------|------|
| Something failed | 5 Whys |
| Planning something risky | Pre-Mortem |
| Choosing between options | Comparative Analysis |
| Understanding a system | Systems Thinking |
| Prioritizing work | Pareto Analysis |
| Not sure | Pre-Mortem (safest default) |

## Hand-offs

| Situation | Route To |
|-----------|----------|
| Need to fix code after analysis | `debugger` skill |
| Document root cause in KB | `retrospective` skill |
| Security issue found | `security-pattern-scanner` skill |
