## Overview

This file defines what Product-Led Spec Kit is (and isn't) to set clear expectations for template adopters.

---

## What This Is

**Product-Led Spec Kit is:**
- {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}
- Product-led development with clear governance workflows
- Works with any agent workflow or framework (not Claude Code-specific)
- Methodology and governance template (not application code)
- Unified Triad workflow with built-in governance and quality gates

**Key Features:**
- SDLC Triad governance (PM → Architect → Team-Lead sign-offs)
- Modular `.claude/rules/` for easy customization
- Local-first `.specify/` file workflows
- Compatible with any tech stack or cloud provider

---

## What This Isn't

**Product-Led Spec Kit is NOT:**
- NOT a quick prototype tool (we follow proper process)
- NOT limited to a single AI agent (supports multi-agent workflows)
- NOT skipping governance for speed (governance is built into every command)
- NOT application code (users bring their own backend/, frontend/, etc.)
- NOT a CI/CD tool (you integrate with your own pipelines)
- NOT a replacement for human oversight (agents assist, humans decide)
