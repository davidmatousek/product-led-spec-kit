# Git Workflow

<!-- Rule file for Product-Led Spec Kit -->

## Overview

All development must use feature branches. Never commit to main directly.

---

## Branch Naming

**Format**: `NNN-descriptive-name`
- **NNN**: Feature ID (e.g., `001`, `002`, `012`)
- **descriptive-name**: Kebab-case description (e.g., `initial-feature`, `user-auth`)

**Examples**:
- `001-initial-feature`
- `012-database-migration`
- `045-api-authentication`

---

## Commit Standards

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use conventional commits format when possible (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep commits atomic and focused on single changes
- Reference feature IDs in commit messages

---

## PR Policies

**Always use feature branches**: `git checkout -b NNN-feature-name`
- Never commit to main directly
- Create PR for review before merge
- Link PR to feature spec (`specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md`)
- Ensure CI/CD passes before merge
- Require at least one approval (if team workflow)
