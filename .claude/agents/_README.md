## Triad Governance Matrix

The SDLC Triad governs key artifacts. This matrix shows each agent's participation.

### Sign-off Authority

| Agent | spec.md | plan.md | tasks.md | Role |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|------|
| product-manager | **APPROVE** | **APPROVE** | **APPROVE** | What & Why |
| architect | Review | **APPROVE** | **APPROVE** | How |
| team-lead | Inform | Review | **APPROVE** | When & Who |

### Veto Authority

| Agent | Can Veto | Domain |
|-------|----------|--------|
| product-manager | Yes | Product scope, user value, business alignment |
| architect | Yes | Technology choices, system design, technical feasibility |
| team-lead | Yes | Timeline, resource allocation, capacity |
| security-analyst | Advisory | Security-critical decisions (escalates to architect) |

### Governance Participation by Agent

| Agent | Participates In | Authority Level |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| architect | plan.md review, technical decisions | Approve/Veto |
| product-manager | spec.md review, PRD creation, scope | Approve/Veto |
| team-lead | tasks.md review, assignments, capacity | Approve/Veto |
| code-reviewer | PR reviews | Approve (code) |
| security-analyst | Security reviews | Advisory |
| tester | Quality validation | Advisory |
| devops | Deployment verification | Execute |
| debugger | None (execution only) | None |
| frontend-developer | None (execution only) | None |
| senior-backend-engineer | None (execution only) | None |
| ux-ui-designer | Design review | Advisory |
| web-researcher | None (execution only) | None |
| orchestrator | Workflow execution | Execute |
