## 1. Core Principles

All agents in Product-Led Spec Kit follow eight core principles. These ensure consistency, maintainability, and optimal performance.

### Principle 1: Conciseness

**Target**: 150-250 lines optimal, 300 lines maximum (with documented justification)

**Why**: Large agent files cause slow context loading and high token consumption. Concise agents load faster and respond more quickly.

**How to achieve**:
- Remove redundant explanations
- Replace verbose paragraphs with bullet points
- Move code examples to skill references
- Eliminate obvious or self-explanatory content

**Example**:
```markdown
# Bad (verbose)
When you need to review the architecture of a system, you should first
carefully examine all the components and understand how they interact
with each other. This involves looking at the database layer, the API
layer, the frontend components, and any external services.

# Good (concise)
Architecture review steps:
- Examine component interactions (database, API, frontend, external services)
- Identify integration points
- Validate against system requirements
```

### Principle 2: Structure

**Target**: All agents use identical 8-section format

**Why**: Consistent structure enables predictable navigation, easier customization, and automated validation. Template adopters know exactly where to find information.

**Required Sections** (in order):
1. Core Mission
2. Role Definition
3. When to Use
4. Workflow Steps
5. Quality Standards
6. Triad Governance
7. Tools & Skills
8. Success Criteria

**See**: [Section 2: Standard Agent Structure](#2-standard-agent-structure) for detailed template.

### Principle 3: Boundaries

**Target**: Every agent explicitly documents what it does NOT do

**Why**: Clear scope limits prevent confusion, reduce overlap between agents, and help template adopters select the right agent for each task.

**How to document**:
```yaml
boundaries:
  does_not_handle:
    - Code implementation (use senior-backend-engineer or frontend-developer)
    - Security audits (use security-analyst)
    - Testing strategy (use tester)
```

**Example boundary statements**:
- architect: "Does not write production code - delegates to engineering agents"
- product-manager: "Does not make technical decisions - defers to architect"
- debugger: "Does not implement fixes - identifies root cause only"

### Principle 4: Context Efficiency

**Target**: Reference skills instead of embedding code; minimize inline examples

**Why**: Embedded code examples inflate agent size without adding value. Skills provide reusable patterns that can be updated independently.

**Preferred approach**:
```markdown
# Bad (embedded code)
When creating a FastAPI endpoint, use this pattern:
[50 lines of code example]

# Good (skill reference)
For API endpoint patterns, invoke skill: `api-patterns`
Reference: .claude/skills/api-patterns/
```

**When inline examples are acceptable**:
- Brief format examples (3-5 lines max)
- Markdown/YAML structure templates
- Output format specifications

### Principle 5: Versioning

**Target**: All agents have semantic version numbers and changelog entries

**Why**: Version tracking enables change history, rollback capability, and clear communication about agent evolution.

**Format**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to agent behavior or structure
- MINOR: New capabilities added (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation improvements

**Changelog format**:
```yaml
changelog:
  - version: 2.0.0
    date: 2026-01-31
    changes:
      - Refactored per best practices
      - Applied 8-section structure
      - Reduced from 1,026 to 250 lines (77% reduction)
  - version: 1.0.0
    date: 2025-06-15
    changes:
      - Initial agent creation
```

### Principle 6: Triad Integration

**Target**: Every agent documents its governance participation clearly

**Why**: The SDLC Triad (PM, Architect, Team-Lead) governs quality gates. Agents must clearly state their role in sign-offs and when they defer to other roles.

**Governance documentation**:
```yaml
triad_governance:
  participates_in:
    - plan.md sign-off (architect review)
    - Technical decisions (architecture authority)
  veto_authority:
    - Technology stack choices
    - System design patterns
  defers_to:
    - product-manager: Product scope decisions
    - team-lead: Timeline and resource allocation
```

### Principle 7: Skill Delegation

**Target**: Delegate specialized work to skills; agents orchestrate, skills execute

**Why**: Skills are reusable, testable, and can be updated independently. Agents should focus on decision-making and workflow, not detailed execution.

**When to delegate**:
- Code generation patterns
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures
- Research methodologies

**Agent vs Skill responsibilities**:
| Agent | Skill |
|-------|-------|
| Decides what to build | Provides code patterns |
| Orchestrates workflow | Executes specific tasks |
| Makes judgment calls | Follows defined procedures |
| Validates outcomes | Generates artifacts |

### Principle 8: Preservation-First Enhancement

**Target**: When refactoring, inventory capabilities BEFORE making changes

**Why**: Aggressive refactoring can inadvertently remove critical capabilities. Preservation-first ensures all functionality is retained.

**Process summary**:
1. Read and document all current capabilities
2. Categorize content (Keep/Condense/Reference/Remove)
3. Apply changes systematically
4. Validate all capabilities preserved

**See**: [Section 5: Preservation-First Enhancement](#5-preservation-first-enhancement) for full 11-step process.

---

## 5. Preservation-First Enhancement

When refactoring agents, follow this 11-step process to ensure no capabilities are lost.

### The 11-Step Process

#### Phase A: Inventory

**Step 1: Read Original**
- Open the current agent file
- Read completely without modification
- Note overall structure and length

**Step 2: Extract Capabilities**
- List every function/capability the agent provides
- Document each workflow the agent supports
- Identify all integration points

**Step 3: Document Dependencies**
- List skills the agent invokes
- List other agents it collaborates with
- Note external tools or systems

#### Phase B: Categorize

**Step 4: Create Content Categories**

| Category | Action | Criteria |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Keep** | Retain as-is | Core functionality, essential workflows |
| **Condense** | Shorten | Verbose explanations, redundant text |
| **Reference** | Move to skill | Code examples, detailed procedures |
| **Remove** | Delete | Redundant, obvious, or outdated content |

**Step 5: Assign Each Section**
- Walk through agent section by section
- Assign category to each paragraph/list
- Document reasoning for removals

#### Phase C: Transform

**Step 6: Apply Structure Template**
- Copy 8-section template
- Map existing content to new sections
- Fill in required metadata

**Step 7: Condense Verbose Content**
- Convert paragraphs to bullet points
- Remove obvious explanations
- Tighten language (active voice, fewer words)

**Step 8: Create Skill References**
- Move code examples to skills (if not exists, note for future)
- Replace inline code with skill invocation
- Keep only format/structure examples

**Step 9: Add Metadata**
- Create YAML frontmatter
- Set version to 2.0.0 (major refactor)
- Document changes in changelog
- Define boundaries

#### Phase D: Validate

**Step 10: Run Quality Checklist**
- Complete 8-criterion checklist
- Address any failures
- Document any exceptions

**Step 11: Test with Representative Tasks**
- Run 3-5 typical tasks the agent handles
- Verify all capabilities work
- Compare output quality to original

## 6. Template Variables

Template variables enable customization for different tech stacks while maintaining consistent methodology.

### When to Use Template Variables

| Use Template Variable | Use Concrete Value |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Technology choices (framework, database) | Methodology (Triad, 5 Whys) |
| Cloud provider specifics | Product-Led Spec Kit processes |
| Tech stack configurations | Governance workflows |
| Environment-specific values | Quality standards |

### Standard Template Variables

| Variable | Example Values | Usage |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| `{{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK}}` | React, Vue, Angular | Frontend agent tech references |
| `{{BACKEND_FRAMEWORK}}` | FastAPI, Express, Django | Backend agent tech references |
| `{{DATABASE}}` | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL | Data layer references |
| `{{CLOUD_PROVIDER}}` | GCP, AWS, Azure | Infrastructure references |
| `{{TEST_FRAMEWORK}}` | pytest, Jest, Vitest | Testing references |
| `{{CI_PLATFORM}}` | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI | DevOps references |

### Examples

**Correct usage**:
```markdown
# Technology (use variable)
Deploy to {{CLOUD_PROVIDER}} using the configured CI/CD pipeline.
Use {{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK}} component patterns.

# Methodology (use concrete)
Follow the Triad governance process for sign-offs.
Apply 5 Whys methodology for root cause analysis.
```

**Incorrect usage**:
```markdown
# Wrong: Variable for methodology
Follow the {{GOVERNANCE_PROCESS}} for sign-offs.

# Wrong: Concrete for tech choice
Deploy to Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Run.
```

---

## 7. Common Patterns

Reusable patterns for common agent scenarios.

### Governance Sign-off Pattern

```markdown
## Triad Governance

### Sign-off Participation

| Artifact | This Agent's Role | Authority |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| spec.md | Reviewer | APPROVE required |
| plan.md | Primary reviewer | APPROVE required |
| tasks.md | Informed | INFORM only |

### Sign-off Workflow

1. Receive artifact for review
2. Evaluate against quality criteria
3. Provide verdict: APPROVED or CHANGES REQUESTED
4. Document reasoning in sign-off notes
```

### Handoff Pattern

```markdown
## Handoff Protocol

### Receiving Work

When receiving from [source-agent]:
- Expect: [artifact description]
- Validate: [validation criteria]
- Proceed if: [conditions for proceeding]

### Delivering Work

When handing to [target-agent]:
- Provide: [artifact description]
- Include: [required context]
- Notify: [communication method]
```

### Error Escalation Pattern

```markdown
## Error Handling

### Escalation Levels

1. **Self-resolve**: Minor issues, retry with different approach
2. **Peer consult**: Invoke related agent for input
3. **User escalation**: Block on critical decision, request clarification

### When to Escalate

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Missing requirements | Escalate to product-manager |
| Technical conflict | Escalate to architect |
| Resource constraint | Escalate to team-lead |
```

---

## 8. Examples

### Example: Minimal Agent (150 lines)

Agents that primarily orchestrate or have narrow scope can achieve 150 lines.

**Characteristics**:
- Single primary workflow
- Few integration points
- Limited governance participation
- Delegates most work to skills

**Agents in this category**: web-researcher, frontend-developer

### Example: Standard Agent (200-250 lines)

Most agents fall in this range with balanced responsibilities.

**Characteristics**:
- 2-3 workflows
- Multiple integration points
- Clear governance role
- Mix of orchestration and light execution

**Agents in this category**: tester, devops, security-analyst

### Example: Complex Agent (250-300 lines)

Agents with significant governance or orchestration responsibilities.

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple complex workflows
- Many integration points
- Heavy governance participation
- Coordinates other agents

**Agents in this category**: architect, product-manager, orchestrator

### Example: Agent Requiring Split

When an agent exceeds 300 lines despite best efforts, consider splitting by concern.

**Indicators**:
- Two distinct responsibility areas
- Users invoke for very different purposes
- Separate concerns could work independently

**Split pattern** (team-lead example from Feature 003):
```
team-lead.md (1,346 lines - BEFORE)
         │
         ├── Governance concerns
         │   └── team-lead.md (210 lines - AFTER)
         │
         └── Orchestration concerns
             └── orchestrator.md (255 lines - NEW)

Result: 84% reduction in team-lead.md, clear separation of concerns
```

---

## 9. Lessons Learned (Feature 003)

Key insights from the agent refactoring effort (Feature 003, 2026-01-31):

### What Worked Well

1. **Preservation-First Approach**: Inventorying capabilities before refactoring prevented functionality loss. All 12 original agents retained their capabilities.

2. **8-Section Template**: Consistent structure made agents predictable and easier to navigate. 100% adoption achieved across all 13 agents.

3. **Split Decision for team-lead**: Separating governance (team-lead) from execution (orchestrator) resolved scope creep and reduced complexity. Combined 1,346 lines became 465 lines (210 + 255).

4. **Parallel Quality Audits**: Running structure audits, metadata audits, and line count checks in parallel accelerated validation.

### Metrics Achieved

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total Lines | 7,885 | 3,287 | 58% reduction |
| Largest Agent | 1,346 | 291 | 78% reduction |
| Agents Over 300 Lines | 4 | 0 | 100% compliance |
| Average Lines | 657 | 253 | 61% reduction |

### Recommendations for Future Refactoring

1. **Create backup branch first**: `003-agent-backup` saved original state for rollback capability.
2. **Batch similar agents**: Refactoring agents in groups (e.g., all Quality agents) identified shared patterns.
3. **Update cross-references last**: Wave 6.3 (cross-reference validation) caught 8+ files needing updates.
4. **Test with representative tasks**: Each agent should be validated with 2-3 typical use cases post-refactoring.
