# Documentation Update Checklist - After New Feature

**Purpose**: Ensure all documentation stays current after implementing new features
**When to Use**: After merging any feature branch to main
**Owner**: Feature implementer (with PM/Architect review)

## Automation Opportunities

Consider automating documentation updates where possible:

### Auto-Update Candidates
- **Tech Stack**: Parse package.json for dependency versions
- **API Docs**: Generate from OpenAPI spec
- **Coverage**: Auto-update test coverage metrics
- **Version**: Use conventional commits for CHANGELOG

### Manual Updates Required
- Product decisions and rationale
- Architectural context and trade-offs
- Operational procedures
- Institutional knowledge and learnings

---

## Documentation Debt

If you can't update all documentation immediately:

1. **Create GitHub Issues** for documentation debt
   - Label: `documentation`
   - Link to feature PR
   - Specify which docs need updating

2. **Track in docs/TODO.md** (create if needed)
   ```markdown
   ## Documentation TODOs
   - [ ] Update API docs for new /api/tasks endpoint (Feature 042)
   - [ ] Add ADR for Redis caching decision (Feature 043)
   ```

3. **Set Reminder** in calendar for documentation cleanup (weekly/monthly)

---

## Sign-Off

After completing this checklist:

**Documentation Updates Complete**: ✅
**Reviewed By**: [PM/Architect/Team-Lead]
**Date**: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

**Notes**: [Any documentation that was intentionally skipped and why]

---

## Template Customization

**Project-Specific Additions**:
- Add sections for your specific documentation structure
- Include links to documentation standards
- Reference project-specific documentation tools

**Remove if Not Applicable**:
- Sections for documentation you don't maintain
- Tools you don't use (OpenAPI, CHANGELOG, etc.)

---

**Last Updated**: {{CURRENT_DATE}}
**Maintained By**: All team members
**Review Trigger**: When documentation structure changes
