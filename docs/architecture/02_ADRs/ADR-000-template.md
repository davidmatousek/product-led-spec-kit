# ADR-000: Template for Architecture Decision Records

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: {{CURRENT_DATE}}
**Deciders**: Architect, {{TEAM_MEMBERS}}

---

## Context

[Describe the issue or decision that needs to be made. Include relevant background and constraints.]

**Example**:
> We need to choose a database for our application. The system will store user data, task information, and metadata with complex relationships. We expect to handle 10,000+ users with concurrent access patterns.

---

## Decision

[State the decision clearly in one sentence, then explain the approach.]

**Example**:
> We will use **PostgreSQL** as our primary database.

---

## Rationale

[Explain why this decision was made. What were the key factors?]

**Reasons**:
1. **Strong ACID guarantees**: Critical for task locking and concurrent operations
2. **Rich query capabilities**: Supports complex joins and relationships
3. **Mature ecosystem**: Well-supported ORMs (Prisma, Drizzle) and tooling
4. **Scalability**: Proven at scale with partitioning and replication
5. **Open source**: No vendor lock-in, widely known

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: MongoDB
**Pros**:
- Flexible schema
- Horizontal scaling built-in
- Good for unstructured data

**Cons**:
- Weaker consistency guarantees
- Complex queries less efficient
- Our data has clear relationships

**Why Not Chosen**: Data model is highly relational; ACID guarantees are critical

### Alternative 2: MySQL
**Pros**:
- Similar features to PostgreSQL
- Slightly faster for simple queries
- Wide adoption

**Cons**:
- Less advanced features (JSON, full-text search)
- Weaker JSON support
- Licensing concerns (Oracle)

**Why Not Chosen**: PostgreSQL's advanced features outweigh marginal performance gains

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Strong data consistency for task locking
- ✅ Excellent ORM support (Prisma)
- ✅ Powerful query capabilities
- ✅ Well-known technology (easy to hire for)

### Negative
- ⚠️ Requires careful indexing for performance
- ⚠️ Horizontal scaling more complex than NoSQL
- ⚠️ Learning curve for advanced features

### Mitigation
- Use Prisma for type-safe queries and automatic migrations
- Implement proper indexing from the start
- Document query patterns and optimization guidelines

**Template Instructions**: Copy this template for each new ADR. Number sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.). Update status as decision evolves (Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated).

**Statuses**:
- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision made and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Superseded by newer decision (link to replacement ADR)
- **Rejected**: Proposed but not accepted
