# User Stories - {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Last Updated**: {{CURRENT_DATE}}
**Owner**: Product Manager (product-manager)
**Status**: Template - Complete after MVP launch

---

## When to Create This

**Create detailed user stories AFTER your MVP launches.**

Before MVP:
- High-level features in your PRD are sufficient
- Detailed stories emerge from real usage patterns
- You'll waste time on stories for features that change

**Pre-MVP**: Use PRD feature list → build MVP
**Post-MVP**: Break down backlog items into user stories based on actual needs

**Exception**: You can create user stories for complex MVP features that need detailed acceptance criteria.

## Overview

User stories describe features from the user's perspective. They follow the format:
> **As a** [persona], **I want** [capability], **so that** [benefit]

---

## User Story Template

```markdown
## US-NNN: [Story Title]

**As a** [persona from target-users.md],
**I want** [capability or action],
**so that** [business value or user benefit].

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]

### Related
- **Persona**: [Link to target-users.md]
- **PRD**: [Link to relevant PRD]
- **Priority**: [P0 Critical | P1 High | P2 Medium | P3 Low]

### Notes
[Additional context or constraints]
```

## User Story Prioritization

### P0 - Critical (Must Have)
- Blocks core user workflows
- Required for product to function
- Legal or security requirements

### P1 - High (Should Have)
- High user value
- Significant pain point resolution
- Competitive differentiation

### P2 - Medium (Nice to Have)
- Moderate user value
- Quality of life improvements
- Secondary workflows

### P3 - Low (Future)
- Low user value
- Edge cases
- Deferred for later phases

---

## Integration with PRDs

Each PRD should include relevant user stories:
- PRD functional requirements map to user stories
- User story acceptance criteria become PRD requirements
- User stories validated during spec creation

---

**Template Instructions**: Organize user stories by phase or feature area. Delete this message after creating your first user stories.
