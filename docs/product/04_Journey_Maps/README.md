# Customer Journey Maps - {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Last Updated**: {{CURRENT_DATE}}
**Owner**: Product Manager (head-honcho)
**Status**: Template - Complete after MVP launch

---

## When to Create This

**Create journey maps AFTER your MVP launches and you have real users.**

Before MVP:
- Your assumptions about user journeys are untested
- You don't know actual pain points vs. imagined ones
- The onboarding flow doesn't exist yet

**Pre-MVP**: Focus on `/triad.vision` (target users) → build MVP
**Post-MVP**: Map real user journeys based on actual behavior and feedback

---

## Overview

Customer journey maps visualize the end-to-end experience of users interacting with {{PROJECT_NAME}}. They help identify pain points, opportunities, and moments that matter.
