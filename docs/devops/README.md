## Deployment Policy (MANDATORY)

**ALL deployments MUST go through the devops agent.**

Before deploying to ANY environment:
1. Invoke devops agent (never run deploy commands directly)
2. DevOps reads: `docs/architecture/04_deployment_environments/{env}.md`
3. DevOps reads: `docs/devops/{01_Local|02_Staging|03_Production}/README.md`
4. DevOps outputs verification summary
5. Only then proceed with deployment

**Never deploy without verification** - Mismatched targets can cause data loss or service disruption.

## Environment Strategy

```
Development (Local):
  - Docker Compose for services
  - Local PostgreSQL
  - Fast iteration
  - Cost: $0

Staging ({{STAGING_PLATFORM}}):
  - Production-like configuration
  - Separate database
  - Auto-deploy on PR
  - Cost: {{STAGING_COST}}

Production ({{PRODUCTION_PLATFORM}}):
  - Auto-scaling
  - Monitoring and alerts
  - Manual promotion
  - Cost: {{PRODUCTION_COST}}
```
