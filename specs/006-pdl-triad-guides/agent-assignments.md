## 1. Agent Assignment Matrix

### 1.1 Assignment Rationale

This is a **documentation-only feature** — all deliverables are markdown files in `docs/guides/`. No code, APIs, infrastructure, or runtime logic. Assignment decisions follow these principles:

- **frontend-developer**: Primary implementer for all guide authoring. This agent's expertise in user-facing documentation, developer experience writing, ASCII diagram construction, and content structure makes it the natural fit for creating and enhancing quickstart guides, infographics, and lifecycle references. All 50 tasks are documentation-centric with no procedural logic.
- **tester**: Cross-validation tasks in Phase 6 (T042-T050) where the objective is verifying consistency across deliverables without modifying them. Independent verification checks that confirm acceptance criteria are met.

**Why not senior-backend-engineer?** Unlike feature 005 (which required procedural workflow logic in SKILL.md files), feature 006 produces only narrative/visual markdown documentation. There is no ID generation, table manipulation, conditional logic, or subagent invocation. The frontend-developer agent's focus on user-facing content and developer experience is the better match.

**Why single-agent primary?** The plan explicitly identifies that all three guides must be cross-consistent (same commands, same paths, same terminology). Writing them sequentially with a single agent ensures consistency without a reconciliation pass. The infographic structure also informs the quickstart overview diagram, creating a natural dependency chain.

### 1.2 Agent-to-Task Mapping

### 1.3 Agent Workload Summary

| Agent | Tasks Assigned | Task IDs | Load % |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------|
| frontend-developer | 41 | T001-T041 | 82% |
| tester | 9 | T042-T050 | 18% |

**Note**: The frontend-developer's 82% load is appropriate because this is a documentation-only feature with no parallel execution opportunity in the writing phases. The writing tasks are sequential by design (cross-reference consistency requires it). The tester's 18% load is concentrated in a single parallel burst at the end (Phase 6).

---

## 2. Parallel Execution Waves

### Wave Strategy: Single-Agent Sequential with Parallel Verification Finale

The plan specifies a Two-Wave sequential execution strategy. This translates to 6 execution waves aligned with the 6 task phases. Waves 1-5 are strictly sequential (single-agent writing), while Wave 6 enables full parallelism across 9 independent verification checks.

```
Wave 1 ──> Wave 2 ──> Wave 3 ──> Wave 4 ──> Wave 5 ──> Wave 6
Setup      Quickstart  Infographic Lifecycle  Cleanup    Cross-Validation
(6 tasks)  (13 tasks)  (7 tasks)   (11 tasks) (4 tasks)  (9 tasks)
```

### Wave 1: Content Source Setup (Phase 1)

**Duration Estimate**: 15 minutes

---

### Wave 3: Visual Reference Infographic (Phase 3)

**Objective**: Create `docs/guides/PDL_TRIAD_INFOGRAPHIC.md` as single-page ASCII visual
**Agent**: frontend-developer (T020-T026)

### Wave 4: Lifecycle Enhancement (Phase 4)

**Objective**: Enhance existing `docs/guides/PDL_TRIAD_LIFECYCLE.md` with visual diagram, sign-off details, artifact examples, and reference tables within 195-line addition budget
**Agent**: frontend-developer (T027-T037)

| Task | Agent | Parallel | Dependencies |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| T027 | frontend-developer | No | Wave 3 complete (cross-references need infographic path) |
| T028 | frontend-developer | No | T027 (diagram follows cross-references) |
| T029 | frontend-developer | No | T028 (sign-offs follow diagram) |
| T030 | frontend-developer | No | T029 (first artifact example) |

| T036 | frontend-developer | No | T035 (summary table after commands) |
| T037 | frontend-developer | No | T036 (validates complete file, line count) |

**Execution**: Strictly sequential — enhancements must fit within 195-line addition budget; each addition reduces remaining budget for subsequent tasks.
**Duration Estimate**: 15 minutes

---

### Wave 5: File Cleanup (Phase 5)

**Objective**: Delete old quickstart, verify references, confirm historical preservation
**Agent**: frontend-developer (T038-T041)

|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| T038 | frontend-developer | No | Waves 2-4 complete |
| T039 | frontend-developer | No | T038 (search after delete) |
| T040 | frontend-developer | No | T039 (verify preservation) |
| T041 | frontend-developer | No | T040 (evaluate CLAUDE.md last) |

**Execution**: Strictly sequential — delete first, then verify references, then check preservation, then evaluate CLAUDE.md.
**Duration Estimate**: 5 minutes

---

### Wave 6: Cross-Validation and Polish (Phase 6)

**Objective**: Independent verification of consistency, accuracy, and compliance across all three guides
**Agent**: tester (T042-T050)

| T046 | tester | Yes (all parallel) | Wave 5 complete |
| T047 | tester | Yes (all parallel) | Wave 5 complete |
| T048 | tester | Yes (all parallel) | Wave 5 complete |
| T049 | tester | Yes (all parallel) | Wave 5 complete |
| T050 | tester | No | T042-T049 (final compliance check after all verifications) |

**Execution**: T042-T049 in full parallel (8 independent verification checks targeting different aspects), then T050 sequential (final compliance confirmation).
**Duration Estimate**: 5 minutes

## 3. Quality Gates

Quality gates define what must be verified before the orchestrator proceeds to the next wave. Failure at any gate requires resolution before proceeding.

### Gate 1: Content Sources Ready (after Wave 1)

- [ ] All content sources successfully read (PDL_QUICKSTART.md, PDL_TRIAD_LIFECYCLE.md, PDL skills, SPEC_KIT_TRIAD.md, CISO_Agent references)
- [ ] Command syntax extracted and verified against skill definitions
- [ ] Terminology glossary compiled with consistent terms across all sources

**Gatekeeper**: frontend-developer (self-check at T006 completion)
**Failure action**: Re-read missing sources; resolve terminology conflicts before proceeding

---

### Gate 2: Unified Quickstart Complete (after Wave 2)

- [ ] `docs/guides/PDL_TRIAD_QUICKSTART.md` exists
- [ ] All 13 required content sections present (header, diagram, What is PDL, What is Triad, Quick Start, PDL commands, Triad commands, ICE scoring, Handoff, Roles, Sign-offs, File Locations, Troubleshooting)
- [ ] Command syntax matches `.claude/skills/pdl-*/SKILL.md` definitions
- [ ] ICE scoring anchors match PDL skill definitions (H9/M6/L3, thresholds P0/P1/P2/Deferred)
- [ ] Cross-references use relative paths from `docs/guides/`
- [ ] File is under ~270 lines

**Gatekeeper**: frontend-developer (T019 verification task)
**Failure action**: Return to specific section task for correction; line count is highest risk factor

---

### Gate 3: Visual Reference Complete (after Wave 3)

- [ ] `docs/guides/PDL_TRIAD_INFOGRAPHIC.md` exists
- [ ] Complete PDL + Triad flow visible in one continuous scan
- [ ] All Triad sign-off gates shown at correct phases (PRD: triple, Specify: PM, Plan: dual, Tasks: triple)
- [ ] Auto-defer gate shown in PDL section
- [ ] Artifact trail chain visible
- [ ] No narrative paragraphs — purely visual with labels
- [ ] File is under ~160 lines

**Gatekeeper**: frontend-developer (T026 verification task)
**Failure action**: Return to specific visual section for correction; narrative text is the highest risk

---

### Gate 4: Lifecycle Enhancement Complete (after Wave 4)

- [ ] Existing 205-line content fully preserved (stage descriptions, traceability model, status flows, end-to-end example)
- [ ] Visual flow diagram added at top (~25 lines)
- [ ] Cross-references section present
- [ ] Triad sign-off details added to Stages 6-10
- [ ] At least 4 of 6 concrete artifact examples included
- [ ] Commands-by-stage reference table present
- [ ] Summary table (Stage, Artifact, Purpose, Owner) present
- [ ] File is under ~400 lines
- [ ] Addition budget respected (~195 lines of new content)

**Gatekeeper**: frontend-developer (T037 verification task)
**Failure action**: If over line budget, prioritize P0 additions over P1 artifact examples. If existing content modified, revert and re-apply enhancements. This is a CRITICAL gate -- destroying existing content is the highest-severity risk.

---

### Gate 5: Cleanup Complete (after Wave 5)

- [ ] `docs/guides/PDL_QUICKSTART.md` successfully deleted
- [ ] No active codebase references to `PDL_QUICKSTART.md` remain (excluding `specs/005-*/` historical files)
- [ ] Historical files in `specs/005-*/` confirmed unchanged via `git diff`
- [ ] CLAUDE.md evaluated and updated if needed

**Gatekeeper**: frontend-developer (T040/T041 verification)
**Failure action**: If historical files were modified, revert immediately. If active references remain, update them to point to `PDL_TRIAD_QUICKSTART.md`.

---

### Gate 6: Production Ready (after Wave 6)

- [ ] PDL command syntax identical across all three guides and matches skill definitions
- [ ] Triad command syntax identical across all three guides
- [ ] File paths consistent across all three guides
- [ ] Terminology consistent across all three guides (per glossary from T006)
- [ ] Each guide cross-references the other two plus `docs/SPEC_KIT_TRIAD.md`
- [ ] All cross-reference links use correct relative paths from `docs/guides/`
- [ ] Line counts within target ranges (quickstart ~270, lifecycle ~400, infographic ~160)
- [ ] Historical files in `specs/005-*/` unchanged
- [ ] Old quickstart `PDL_QUICKSTART.md` confirmed deleted
- [ ] Local-first compliance confirmed (pure markdown, ASCII art, no external images or dependencies)

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T042-T050)
**Failure action**: Identify specific inconsistency, return to frontend-developer for correction in the affected guide(s). All Wave 6 checks should pass if Gates 1-5 were properly validated — failures here indicate a gate was bypassed or a regression occurred during cleanup.

## 4. Time Estimates

### Per-Wave Estimates

| Wave | Phase | Tasks | Agent(s) | Optimistic | Realistic | Pessimistic |
|------|-------|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Wave 1 | Setup | 6 | frontend-developer | 5 min | 8 min | 12 min |
| Wave 2 | Quickstart (US1) | 13 | frontend-developer | 10 min | 15 min | 20 min |
| Wave 3 | Infographic (US2) | 7 | frontend-developer | 8 min | 12 min | 18 min |
| Wave 4 | Lifecycle (US3) | 11 | frontend-developer | 10 min | 15 min | 22 min |
| Wave 5 | Cleanup | 4 | frontend-developer | 3 min | 5 min | 8 min |
| Wave 6 | Cross-Validation | 9 | tester | 3 min | 5 min | 8 min |
| **Total** | | **50** | | **39 min** | **60 min** | **88 min** |

### Confidence Assessment

- **Confidence Level**: HIGH (90%)
- **Basis**: All deliverables are markdown files with well-defined structures. No external dependencies, no build steps, no runtime code. Content sources are all available and verified in research.md. The CISO_Agent reference implementations provide proven templates to adapt. The team-lead sign-off on tasks.md estimated ~50 minutes for single-agent sequential execution.
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Line count overruns on lifecycle enhancement (mitigated by P0/P1 prioritization and line budget tracking at T037)
  - Existing content preservation during lifecycle enhancement (mitigated by explicit preservation rules and git diff verification at T040, T048)
  - ASCII art rendering inconsistency across platforms (mitigated by using only standard Unicode box-drawing characters)

### Critical Path

```
Wave 1 -> Wave 2 -> Wave 3 -> Wave 4 -> Wave 5 -> Wave 6
  8min     15min     12min     15min      5min      5min   = 60 min (realistic)
```

The critical path is fully sequential through Waves 1-5 because each writing phase depends on the previous (cross-references, diagram consistency, terminology). Wave 6 is the only wave with significant parallelism (8 of 9 tasks run concurrently). The critical path cannot be shortened through additional agents because the interdependency between guides requires single-author consistency.

### MVP Delivery Point

**After Wave 3** (Quickstart + Infographic complete): The two highest-value deliverables exist — the unified onboarding document and the visual reference. Estimated MVP delivery at **35 min** (realistic). Waves 4-6 (lifecycle enhancement, cleanup, cross-validation) complete the full scope.
