## 1. Agent Assignment Matrix

### 1.1 Assignment Rationale

This is a **methodology-only template project** (all markdown files, no runtime code). The deliverables are SKILL.md files, command wrappers, and documentation -- all authored as structured markdown with embedded workflow logic. Assignment decisions follow these principles:

- **senior-backend-engineer**: Primary implementer for all skill and command authoring. Skill files contain procedural workflow logic (conditionals, ID generation, table manipulation, subagent invocation) that maps to backend engineering patterns, even though the output is markdown. This agent has the strongest spec-to-implementation discipline.
- **frontend-developer**: Documentation tasks where the focus is user-facing guides, quickstart content, and developer experience writing. No procedural logic required.
- **tester**: Verification and validation tasks that confirm deliverables meet acceptance criteria without modifying them.
- **product-manager**: PM validation tasks embedded within skill workflows (T017, T025) where product judgment is required at runtime, and final documentation review for user-facing accuracy.
- **code-reviewer**: Final cross-cutting review before phase sign-off.

### 1.3 Agent Workload Summary

| Agent | Tasks Assigned | Task IDs | Load % |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------|
| senior-backend-engineer | 34 | T001-T002, T004-T009, T011-T013, T015-T020, T022-T026, T030-T037, T043-T047 | 55% |
| tester | 24 | T003, T010, T014, T021, T027-T029, T038-T040, T048-T062 | 39% |
| frontend-developer | 2 | T041-T042 | 3% |
| product-manager | 2 (runtime) | T017, T025 (invoked as subagent during skill execution) | 3% |

**Note**: product-manager tasks (T017, T025) are invoked at runtime via the Task tool within pdl-validate and pdl-run skills. The senior-backend-engineer authors the invocation logic; the product-manager agent executes the PM validation gate when the skill is actually run by a user. These are not implementation-time assignments but runtime delegation patterns.

## 2. Parallel Execution Waves

### Wave Strategy: Phase-Per-Agent with Parallel Sub-Waves

Given that this is a single-agent primary workload (senior-backend-engineer) with a methodology-only template, the optimal strategy is **Phase-Per-Agent** execution. The senior-backend-engineer handles all authoring sequentially (avoiding file conflicts), while the tester validates after each phase. Parallel opportunities exist within phases where tasks target independent files.

```

## 3. Quality Gates

Quality gates define what must be verified before the orchestrator proceeds to the next wave. Failure at any gate requires resolution before proceeding.

### Gate 1: Foundation Ready (after Wave 1)

- [ ] `docs/product/_backlog/01_IDEAS.md` exists with correct 6-column table header
- [ ] `docs/product/_backlog/02_USER_STORIES.md` exists with correct 6-column table header
- [ ] Table headers match FR-1 and FR-2 field definitions exactly
- [ ] Existing individual backlog files are preserved (not deleted or modified)

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T003)
**Failure action**: Return to senior-backend-engineer for correction

---

### Gate 2: Core Skill Logic Established (after Wave 2)

- [ ] pdl-idea SKILL.md has valid `name` and `description` frontmatter only
- [ ] Auto-create backlog files logic implemented
- [ ] Idea capture flow generates IDEA-NNN IDs correctly
- [ ] ICE scoring presents H9/M6/L3 quick-assessment
- [ ] Auto-defer gate applies threshold <12
- [ ] Priority tiers defined: P0 (25-30), P1 (18-24), P2 (12-17), Deferred (<12)
- [ ] File is under 500 lines

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T010)
**Failure action**: Return to senior-backend-engineer; line count is highest risk

---

### Gate 3: Re-Scoring Skill Complete (after Wave 3)

- [ ] pdl-score SKILL.md implements lookup by IDEA-NNN
- [ ] Re-scoring flow preserves Validated status
- [ ] Old vs new comparison displayed
- [ ] File under 500 lines
- [ ] ICE thresholds consistent with pdl-idea

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T014)
**Failure action**: Return to senior-backend-engineer

---

### Gate 4: PM Validation Skill Complete (after Wave 4)

- [ ] pdl-validate SKILL.md uses Task tool with product-manager subagent
- [ ] Rejection updates status to Rejected in 01_IDEAS.md
- [ ] Approval generates user story with US-NNN ID
- [ ] Approval appends to 02_USER_STORIES.md
- [ ] Approval updates idea status to Validated in 01_IDEAS.md
- [ ] File under 500 lines

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T021)
**Failure action**: Return to senior-backend-engineer

---

### Gate 5: Full Flow Skill Complete (after Wave 5)

- [ ] pdl-run SKILL.md inlines all logic (no Skill tool invocations)
- [ ] Auto-defer gate stops flow and guides to `/pdl.validate`
- [ ] PM validation inlined (not via Skill tool)
- [ ] Summary report includes IDEA-NNN, ICE, PM result, US-NNN, next step
- [ ] File under 500 lines

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T027)
**Failure action**: Return to senior-backend-engineer

---

### Gate 6: Phase 2 Cross-Validation (after Wave 6)

- [ ] All 4 SKILL.md files have ONLY `name` and `description` in frontmatter
- [ ] No `triggers`, `allowed-tools`, or non-standard fields in any skill
- [ ] ICE threshold value "12" consistent across all 4 skills
- [ ] Tier definitions (P0/P1/P2/Deferred) identical across all 4 skills
- [ ] Quick-assessment anchors (H9/M6/L3) identical across all 4 skills
- [ ] No Skill tool invocations within any skill file

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T028-T029)
**Failure action**: Return to senior-backend-engineer for consistency fixes. This is a CRITICAL gate -- inconsistent ICE scoring would undermine the entire scoring framework.

---

### Gate 7: Commands and Handoff Functional (after Wave 7)

- [ ] All 4 command wrappers exist in `.claude/commands/` with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Each command has a `description` field in frontmatter
- [ ] prd-create skill has optional `source.idea_id` and `source.story_id` fields
- [ ] prd-create skill presents "Ready for PRD" entries from 02_USER_STORIES.md
- [ ] triad.prd command updates user story status from "Ready for PRD" to "In PRD"
- [ ] triad.prd gracefully skips if story ID not found

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T038-T040)
**Failure action**: Return to senior-backend-engineer. Handoff tasks (T034-T037) modify existing files -- verify no regressions.

---

### Gate 8: Documentation Complete (after Wave 8)

- [ ] PDL_QUICKSTART.md covers all 4 commands with examples
- [ ] PDL_QUICKSTART.md includes ICE scoring reference and priority tiers

- [ ] Documentation references only `/pdl.*` and `/triad.*` commands (no deprecated names)

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T048-T054)
**Failure action**: Return to authoring agent (frontend-developer for guides, senior-backend-engineer for registrations)

---

### Gate 9: Production Ready (after Wave 9)

- [ ] All 4 skills under 500 lines (NFR-3)
- [ ] All 4 skill directories exist at correct paths
- [ ] All 4 command wrappers exist at correct paths
- [ ] ICE scoring consistent across all skills (threshold, tiers, anchors)
- [ ] No Skill tool invocations within skill files
- [ ] Frontmatter follows Anthropic Agent Skills open standard
- [ ] PDL to Triad handoff verified (source traceability in prd-create)
- [ ] PDL commands discoverable in CLAUDE.md and commands.md

**Gatekeeper**: tester (T055-T062)
**Failure action**: Identify specific failure, return to responsible agent. All Wave 9 checks should pass if Gates 1-8 were properly validated -- failures here indicate a gate was bypassed or a regression occurred.

## 4. Time Estimates

### Per-Wave Estimates

| Wave | Phase | Tasks | Agent(s) | Optimistic | Realistic | Pessimistic |
|------|-------|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Wave 1 | Setup | 3 | senior-backend-engineer, tester | 10 min | 15 min | 20 min |
| Wave 2 | pdl-idea | 7 | senior-backend-engineer, tester | 30 min | 45 min | 60 min |
| Wave 3 | pdl-score | 4 | senior-backend-engineer, tester | 20 min | 30 min | 40 min |
| Wave 4 | pdl-validate | 7 | senior-backend-engineer, tester | 35 min | 45 min | 60 min |
| Wave 5 | pdl-run | 6 | senior-backend-engineer, tester | 30 min | 40 min | 55 min |
| Wave 6 | Phase 2 Validation | 2 | tester | 5 min | 10 min | 15 min |
| Wave 7 | Commands + Handoff | 11 | senior-backend-engineer, tester | 35 min | 50 min | 65 min |
| Wave 8 | Documentation | 14 | frontend-developer, senior-backend-engineer, tester | 35 min | 50 min | 70 min |
| Wave 9 | Polish | 8 | tester | 5 min | 10 min | 15 min |
| **Total** | | **62** | | **3h 25min** | **4h 55min** | **6h 40min** |

### Confidence Assessment

- **Confidence Level**: HIGH (85%)
- **Basis**: All deliverables are markdown files with well-defined structures. No external dependencies, no build steps, no runtime code. The spec, plan, and tasks are thoroughly documented with clear acceptance criteria.
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Skill files approaching 500-line limit (mitigated by per-skill line count checks)
  - ICE scoring consistency across 4 files (mitigated by cross-validation in Wave 6 and Wave 9)
  - Modifying existing files in Phase 3.2 (T034-T037) -- regression risk on prd-create and triad.prd

### Critical Path

The critical path is fully sequential because Phase 2 skills must be built in order (each builds on ICE patterns from the previous skill), and all subsequent phases depend on Phase 2 completion. The 39% parallelization opportunity (24 tasks) reduces wall-clock time within waves but does not shorten the inter-wave critical path.

### MVP Delivery Point

**After Wave 7** (Commands + Handoff complete): All 4 PDL commands are user-invocable and the Triad handoff works. Estimated MVP delivery at **3h 55min** (realistic). Waves 8-9 (documentation and polish) can be deferred if time-constrained.

## 5. Orchestrator Handoff Summary

**Feasibility**: APPROVED (per tasks.md team-lead sign-off)
**Tasks.md Location**: `specs/005-product-discovery-lifecycle/tasks.md`
**Wave Strategy**: 9 waves, Phase-Per-Agent with parallel sub-waves
**Estimated Duration**: 4h 55min (realistic)
**Primary Agent**: senior-backend-engineer (34 tasks, 55% of workload)
**Supporting Agents**: tester (24 tasks), frontend-developer (2 tasks)
**Execution Pattern**: Sequential waves with parallel task groups within Waves 1, 7, 8, 9
